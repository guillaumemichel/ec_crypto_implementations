# Elliptic Curves Cryptography implementations

Some simple implementations for elliptic curve cryptography in sage (python2) written in sage worksheet (.sagews). The worksheets can be opened in Cocalc or in a sage notebook.

## [Weil Paring](weil_pairing.sagews)
Implementation of Weil pairing on Elliptic Curves.

## [Re-encryption Scheme](ec_crypto_reencryption_scheme.sagews)
Algorithm to perform re-encryption on encrypted data using elliptic curves, without revealing the content.

## [Credential Based Cryptography](credential_based_ec_crypto.sagews)
Implementation of a simple credential based elliptic curve cryptosystem.

## [Fast Isogeny Composition](fast_isogeny_composition.sagews)
Algorithm that computes fast isogeny composition using multiplications.
